# Device Manipulation

Device manipulation is where  the game will interact with your computer in ways that other programs usually will not, below is all the features and limits we have setup for each feature.
> 📝 **Note:** This can all be disabled and usually is disabled by default in the options.

## Window Movement [PC ONLY]

Window movement is where your actual game window moves around your desktop, this is usually used to distract you and add an extra layer of difficulty to the gameplay.

Our game has 2 options for it:

- Simulated (Simulated creates a fake desktop in the game and moves around a pretend window. This doesn't touch your actual computer.)
- Real (Real tracks the position of the window and moves it around the available space on your display. This does not do anything malicious and does not touch any functions that godot does not provide us.)

## Wallpaper Changing [PC ONLY]

Wallpaper changing is as the name says, it simply changes your wallpaper. If you exit the game or the game needs to reset it your wallpaper will return to normal.

> 📝 **Note:** If you have something such as lively wallpaper or wallpaper engine installed and running, it may show up above the default OS wallpaper or as a replacement of it. Meaning that we cannot change it, if a wallpaper program is running you wont see it change and we will not close the program for you.

## spooky mouse movement [PC ONLY]

It just moves your mouse, this makes using your mouse impossible while it happens, either pause the game or close the game using a keyboard bind [Alt+F4 for Windows, CMD+Q for Mac OS]
