# Song Request Policy

> If a song is requested from an artist that does not directly work for the game the following applies:

1. The artist may set limits on what content of theirs can and cannot be used, the game itself and community must abide by those set restrictions.
2. The artist is allowed to pull their permissions for song use at any time, if so people are not to harass said artist, any custom community content will be removed from the steam workshop.
3. Artists may reach out and change permissions for the game, removing and giving permissions as they feel fit.
4. Artists may feel free to ask any questions about the game at any time to get a better understanding of what type of game their song is going to be used in.
5. If an artist declines permission that is to be respected and artist is to be added to a blacklist, songs of theirs cannot be used unless they reach out to the developers and give permission, begging the artist will get you nowhere and can possibly lead to a workshop upload ban.
6. If an artist cannot give out permissions for specific songs due to copyright, those songs cannot be used (Exclusive songs fall under this umbrella)
7. Remixes and covers require permission from the original songs creator, not just the person who made the remix.
8. If permission is requested from a player and not a developer then do not take anything they say or do as something endorsed by the developers directly. We only ask for permission ourselves if asking for a collab or requesting permissions for music.
