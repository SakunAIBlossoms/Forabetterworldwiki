# Community Content Policy

- Flag sexual content (lyrical and visual) with the correct tag.
- straight NSFW is strictly prohibited. If found, said content will be removed and you will be blacklisted from uploading anything new to the workshop
- blood and slight gore is allowed (fake open wounds, bruises, blood) only if tagged correctly
- extreme gore is not allowed (dismemberment, organs, raw flesh, real life gore [keep your gore light and fake]), if gore is fake but extreme its allowed only if sillhoutted
- Extreme fetish content is a NO (sexualised gore, scat, urination, anything on this wavelength)
- No malicious software is to be packaged into the content, nor is any content allowed to abuse bugs to cause harm to the users system. if you wanna do something cool that you currently cant, dont exploit a flaw to do it, ask me for it instead, or check with other community members if a way to do so is already provided.
- Swearing is allowed, slurs are not allowed (if a song contains slurs its best to censor them)
- All community levels are unrated, by playing them players agree that whatever they may encounter is not the responsibility of the developers, any abusive content that violates these policies can be reported.
- Links are allowed as long as they do not link to malicious software, scams, or adult sites.
- Keep it safe, do not use community content to doxx, harrass, insult, or spread hatred.
- Avoid bringing politics into your content
- Follow the steam, itch, google play store, and apple app store TOS when creating community content.

## By accessing the editor you agree to follow the above and not violate any of the things listed, if done so we reserve the right to blacklist you from the steam workshop and any community servers

> 📝 **Note:** Although you can be blacklisted from the steam workshop and community servers, this does ***NOT*** remove your right to access features in the game. You may continue to enjoy the game, continue to create community content, and play other people's community content. A blacklist simply means the official ways of sharing community content and interacting with the community were removed.
