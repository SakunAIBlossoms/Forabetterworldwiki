# Collab Policy

> Collabs are a tricky thing, they require planning and development time to produce, thus in order to not fill up on unnecessary or controversial collabs these policies dictate who exactly can be collabed with.

## Collabs with the following will be declined

- Games that are created without the use of artificial intelligence
- games that are blacklisted (ones ive had bad experiences with or just dont like) will not be collabed with, I do not have to tell you why.
- Roblox games
- NSFW games
- Games created by people with bad controversy

## Extra Information

- Communities do not dictate a game, whether a community is bad or not should not matter for a collab
- I may pick and choose to say yes or no to collabs at any time, it could be from something as simple as just not wanting to collab to something as complex as personal grudges. Explanations do not always need to be provided.
- Collabs are a team effort, if a collab is to happen then both parties work together, not independently.
